# Execute PRP (Product Requirements Prompt)

## Description

Execute features using PRP files.

## Usage

Implement complete features based on generated PRP files.

## Execution Process

### 1. Load PRP

- Read the specified PRP file
- Understand all context and requirements
- Follow all PRP instructions and extend research as needed
- Secure all necessary context to fully implement the PRP
- Perform additional web searches and codebase exploration as needed

### 2. ULTRATHINK (Deep Thinking)

- Think deeply before executing the plan
- Generate comprehensive plan addressing all requirements
- Break down complex tasks into manageable small steps
- Identify implementation patterns to follow from existing code
- Determine implementation priorities

### 3. Execute the Plan

- Execute the PRP
- Implement all code
- Progress step by step and validate each step
- Follow existing patterns and conventions

### 4. Validate

- Execute each validation command
- Fix failed parts
- Re-run until all validations pass
- Perform code quality checks

### 5. Complete

- Verify all checklist items are completed
- Run final validation suite
- Report completion status
- Re-read PRP to ensure everything is implemented

### 6. Reference the PRP

- Can always reference the PRP again when needed
- Return to PRP if there are questions during implementation

## Error Handling

If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry.

## Success Criteria

- All features implemented according to PRP requirements
- All validation gates pass
- Code matches existing patterns
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
